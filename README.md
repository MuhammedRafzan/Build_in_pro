Sign-language converter for real time communication.

This project is a real-time sign language conversion system that translates static hand gestures into readable text and audible speech. The system enables effective communication between hearing-impaired individuals and people who do not understand sign language.

Using a camera-based input, the system captures hand gestures and processes them through a gesture recognition model trained on predefined static signs. Once a gesture is recognized, it is instantly converted into text output and optionally synthesized into natural speech, allowing seamless interaction in real time.

The solution does not require specialized hardware such as gloves or sensors, making it cost-effective, portable, and accessible. It focuses on static gestures, ensuring higher accuracy, faster response time, and reliable performance in real-world environments.

This system can be integrated into video calls, public service kiosks, educational platforms, and assistive communication tools, helping bridge the communication gap for deaf and mute individuals while promoting inclusivity and accessibility.
