Bridging Communication Gaps Using Machine Learning & Computer Vision

Introduction 
Sign language is a primary mode of communication for millions of hearing- and speech-impaired individuals worldwide. However, the lack of widespread understanding of sign language creates a significant communication barrier between differently-abled individuals and the general population. This project presents an Intelligent Sign Language Recognition System that automatically recognizes hand gestures and translates them into readable text in real time.
The system integrates computer vision, hand landmark detection, and machine learning classification techniques to interpret sign language gestures using a standard webcam. By eliminating the need for specialized hardware, this solution provides a cost-effective, accessible, and scalable approach to assistive communication. The project demonstrates how AI can be applied to solve real-world social problems while maintaining efficiency and usability.

🧩 Problem Definition
Despite advancements in assistive technologies, communication between sign language users and non-signers remains a challenge due to:
Limited awareness and understanding of sign language
Dependency on human interpreters
High cost of hardware-based gesture recognition systems
Lack of real-time, software-only solutions
There is a strong need for an intelligent, low-cost, real-time system that can accurately interpret sign language gestures and convert them into understandable text.

💡 Proposed Solution
The proposed system is a real-time sign language recognition application that:
Captures live hand gestures using a webcam
Detects and tracks hand landmarks using computer vision
Extracts meaningful features from hand movements
Classifies gestures using trained machine learning models
Displays the corresponding sign as text output
This approach provides a non-intrusive, hardware-independent, and efficient communication aid.

🎯 Objectives
To design a real-time sign language recognition system
To apply machine learning techniques for gesture classification
To improve accessibility for hearing- and speech-impaired individuals
To demonstrate practical use of AI in assistive technology
To create a scalable platform for future enhancements
